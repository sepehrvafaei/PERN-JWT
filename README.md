full stack project, PERN, with authentication and authorization using JWT<br/>
including a to do list app<br/>
made in visual studio 2019.<br/>
client side project is a  node.js and react app and for the set ups and configs I followed the instructions Microsoft at the following link:<br/>
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/javascript/tutorial-nodejs-with-react-and-jsx?view=vs-2019<br/>
server side project is a node.js app using express and when creating it I choosed "blank node.js express 4 application" among the options.
I created the database in pgAdmin 4 using the create option rather than writing sql query, but all the code needed for creating database and tables are in the database file with sql extension.<br/>
I wanna add more features.<br/>
the configuration for connecting to postgresql is in the db file with js extension.<br/>
