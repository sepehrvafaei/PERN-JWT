full stack project, PERN, with authentication and authorization using JWT<br/>
including a to do list app
made in visual studio 2019.
I created the database in pgAdmin 4 using the creat option rather than writing query, but all the code needed for creating database and tables are in the database file with sql extension.
I wanna add more features.
the configuration for connecting to postgresql is in the db file with js extension.
